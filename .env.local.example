# PocketCasts Configuration
# Copy this file to .env.local and fill in your credentials

# PocketCasts login URL (for reference)
pocketcasts sign in link: https://pocketcasts.com/user/login?redirect=%2Fdiscover

# PocketCasts credentials for automated file uploads
# These credentials will be used when the --upload flag is specified
pocketcasts user: your-email@example.com
pocketcasts password: your-password-here

# IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:
# - Never commit .env.local to git (it's already in .gitignore)
# - Use a strong, unique password for your PocketCasts account
# - These credentials are only stored locally on your machine
# - You can override these values using CLI flags:
#   --pocketcasts-email and --pocketcasts-password

# USAGE EXAMPLES:
#
# 1. Upload to PocketCasts using credentials from .env.local:
#    streamstofiles --upload
#
# 2. Override credentials via CLI:
#    streamstofiles --upload --pocketcasts-email "other@email.com" --pocketcasts-password "password"
#
# 3. Upload only the concatenated file (default uploads all files):
#    streamstofiles --upload --upload-mode concatenated
#
# 4. Upload only individual MP3s:
#    streamstofiles --upload --upload-mode individual
